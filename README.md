# [Upgrade Your App to Angular 2][published url]
## Instructor: [Reginald Dawson][instructor url]


If you are an Angular delveloper, you must be aware that Angular 2 is coming soon. 

Since the frameworks are so different, using Angular 2 will require a total rewrite of apps to make them work with the new platform. Angular developers that have implemented their apps using component directives will have an easier time porting to Angular 2, but in many cases there is only a limited possibility to reuse Angular 1 code in Angular 2. Often the best thing to do is to undertake a rewrite of the app, module by module.

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Reggie Dawson will show you how to take a simple Angular 1 app and to upgrade it to use Angular 2. You'll see how each concept and structure in Angular 1 translates to the new version. After viewing this course, you'll have a better understanding of how to migrate your apps to Angular 2.
